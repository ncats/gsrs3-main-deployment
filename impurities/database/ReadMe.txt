Note: we have included a script only for MariaDB because the other database systems
we have tested work fine with Hibernate to generate a database schema.

With MariaDB, the Hibernate-generated SQL causes errors so we include a script that 
yields a useable database.
Note: this may also be the case with MySQL.
