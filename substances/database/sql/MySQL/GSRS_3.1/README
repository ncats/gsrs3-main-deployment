This README provides information on upgrading GSRS from 3.0.x to GSRS 3.1 and deploying directly with GSRS 3.1. 

I. Files in this folder:
1. GSRS_3.1_MySQL_FULL.sql
This is the GSRS_3.1 full database schema file for MySQL. It is equivalent to what Spring JPA generates.
2. GSRS_3.1_MySQL_DELTA.sql
These are the delta scripts including scripts creating new tables, and related new indexes, new sequences and renaming a column compared with last version GSRS3.0.3.
3. InsertVersionInfo.sql
This file is used to insert into the table IX_CORE_DB_GSRS_VERSION to indicate the database schema change. 
It has a procedure and a calling part. Please make changes to the calling part to suit your system. 

II. Steps to update your substances application: 
If you have customized your database, you need to use the delta scripts GSRS_3.1_MySQL_DELTA.sql to apply the changes introduced in GSRS 3.1.
Here are the steps:
1. Stop your substances application.
2. Make sure this is set in the application.conf file: 
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
3. Apply the delta changes to the database using the scripts: GSRS_3.1_MySQL_DELTA.sql. 
4. Restart your substances application. You can set spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto to either none or update before restarting.
5. Reindex. Run the scheduled job:reindex the all core entities from backup tables.
6. If everything works as expected, make appropriate changes to InsertVersionInfo.sql and run it.

If you have not customized your system with database model changesyou can follow the same steps described above.
Or you can run the single last line from GSRS_3.1_MySQL_DELTA.sql 
    alter table ix_ginas_vocabulary_term rename column value to term_value;
in step #3.
Then use spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update in your application.conf file in step #4. 

III. Steps to start your substances application FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
WARNING: Please do NOT follow this if you already have a running GSRS substances.
1. Delete ginas.ix folder if it exists.
2. Start substances with spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update and on command line run "mvn clean -U spring-boot:run -DskipTests". 
3. Start substances with "mvn clean -U spring-boot:run -DskipTests".
4. Start front end and gateway.
5. Login as admin, load data with UI.
Note you do not need to run InsertVersionInfo.sql, the application would insert the database schema version info into the version table.
