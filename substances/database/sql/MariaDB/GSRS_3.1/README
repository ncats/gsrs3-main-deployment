This README provides information on upgrading GSRS from 3.0.x to GSRS 3.1 and deploying directly with GSRS 3.1. 

I. Files in this folder:
1. GSRS_3.1_MariaDB_FULL.sql
This is the GSRS_3.1 full database schema file for MariaDB. It is equivalent to what Spring JPA generates.
2. GSRS_3.1_MariaDB_DELTA.sql
These are the delta scripts including scripts creating new tables, and related new indexes, new sequences and renaming a column compared with last version GSRS3.0.3.
3. InsertVersionInfo.sql
This file is used to insert into the table IX_CORE_DB_GSRS_VERSION to indicate the database schema change. 
It has a procedure and a calling part. Please make changes to the calling part to suit your system.
4. Folder /scripts_with_auto_increment
This folder contains all the sql scripts that use auto_increment instead of sequences. These scripts are for reference if you used them previously. We strongly encourage you use the sql scripts that use sequences in script #1, #2 and #3. In SpringBoot 3, the hibernate generated schema will only use sequences for the auto generated ids, and the option to generate ids with auto_increment will be removed. If you used this set of scripts and have questions, please contact the team @ ncatsgsrs@mail.nih.gov.


II. Steps to start your substances application FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
WARNING: Please do NOT follow this if you already have a running GSRS substances in previous version.
1. Delete ginas.ix folder if it exists.
2. Start substances with spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update and on command line run "mvn clean -U spring-boot:run -DskipTests".
3. Start substances with "mvn clean -U spring-boot:run -DskipTests", and add any additional runtime arguments, such as -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Xmx12000m" to allocate additional memory.
4. Start front end and gateway.
5. Login as admin, load data with UI.
Note you do not need to run InsertVersionInfo.sql, the application would insert the database schema version info into the version table.

III. Steps to UPGRADE your substances application to GSRS3.1:
If you have customized your database, you need to use the delta scripts GSRS_3.1_MariaDB_DELTA.sql to apply the changes introduced in GSRS 3.1.
Here are the steps:
1. Stop your substances application.
2. Make sure this is set in the application.conf file: 
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
3. Apply the delta changes to the database using the scripts: GSRS_3.1_MariaDB_DELTA.sql. 
4. Check the setting of spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto, it should be either none or update before restarting. Then restart your substances application.

--------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE:
--------------------------
a. Use ddl-auto=update or ddl-auto=none
If you have not customized your system with database model changes AND you did not use auto_increment in the table definitions for ids, then use
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update in your application.conf file.
Otherwise use
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none.

b. How to find out whether auto_increment is used
To check whether auto_increment is used. The most easy way is to check the table definition of ix_core_principal:
    SHOW CREATE TABLE ix_core_principal;
If id is defined in the table as
    `id` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
then auto_increment is used. Otherwise it is not used.

5. Reindex. Run the scheduled job:reindex the all core entities from backup tables.
6. If everything works as expected, make appropriate changes to InsertVersionInfo.sql and run it.
