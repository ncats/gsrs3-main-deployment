If you have a GSRS substances application that already runs with version 3.0.x, you can ignore this. 
If you just started experimenting with GSRS 3.0.3, then please continue.

1. GSRS_3.0.3_MariaDB_FULL.sql
This is the full GSRS_3.0.3 database schema for MariaDB. It is equivalent to what Spring JPA generates. 
if you have 
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
or
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update 
in your application.conf config file, you do not need to run this.

2. GSRS_3.0.3_MariaDB_With_Auto_Increment_FULL.sql
We strongly encourage you use the above GSRS_3.0.3_MariaDB_FULL.sql to create you schema as in SpringBoot 3, the hibernate generated schema will only use sequences for the auto generated ids, and the option to generate ids with auto_increment will be removed. 
This file is just for reference if you used this previously. The only difference between these two sql scripts is that ids are generated using sequences in #1, while ids are generated using auto_increment in #2.
