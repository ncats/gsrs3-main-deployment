If you have a GSRS substances application that already runs with version 3.0.x, you can ignore this. 
If you just started experimenting with GSRS 3.0.3, then please continue.

1. GSRS_3.0.3_PostgreSQL_FULL.sql
This is the full GSRS_3.0.3 database schema for PostgreSQL. It is equivalent to what Spring JPA generates. 
if you have 
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
or
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update 
in your application.conf config file, you do not need to run this.
